    <h2>6. User Responsibilities and Acceptable Use</h2>
    
    <p>By using the App, you agree to the following:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>*Personal Use Only:* The App is licensed for your personal, non-commercial, and educational use only. You may not use it for professional medical practice or share your subscription with others.</li>
      <li>*Age Requirement:* You must be at least 18 years old to use the App, or be between 13-17 years old with the explicit consent and supervision of a parent or guardian.</li>
      <li>*Prohibited Conduct:* You will not attempt to reverse engineer, decompile, modify, or create derivative works of the App. You will also not use the App for any illegal or unauthorized purpose.</li>
      <li>*Review of Input Data:* When you use the "Upload/Scan Lab" button to scan lab reports, you understand and agree that it is your responsibility to review and confirm the accuracy of all extracted lab values, reference ranges, and units. Optical character recognition (OCR) is not always 100% accurate, and incorrect inputs may result in misleading or incorrect interpretations. You must carefully review and correct any errors before relying on the results.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>7. Data, Privacy, and Security</h2>
    <p>Your privacy is our top priority. As detailed in our <a href="[Link to Privacy Policy]" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Privacy Policy</a>, Labxio does not collect any personal health data. All information you enter is stored *locally on your device only*.</p>
    
    <div class="highlight-box">
      <h3>Important: Data Loss Responsibility</h3>
      <p>Because your data is stored locally, Labxio cannot recover it. You are solely responsible for protecting your device and data. We are not liable for any data loss resulting from device damage, loss, theft, app uninstallation, or a device factory reset.</p>
    </div>

    <h2>8. Disclaimer of Warranties</h2>
    <p>THE APP IS PROVIDED ON AN "AS IS" AND "AS AVAILABLE" BASIS.

WE DO NOT WARRANT THAT THE APP WILL BE UNINTERRUPTED, ERROR-FREE, SECURE, OR ACCURATE IN ITS INTERPRETATIONS.</p>

    <h3>Limitations of Accuracy</h3>
    <p>While Labxio strives to provide accurate and educational interpretations of lab results based on established medical guidelines, we cannot guarantee the accuracy, completeness, or reliability of any analysis. The App relies on text recognition (OCR), user-entered data, and automated interpretation algorithms — all of which may contain errors. Potential sources of inaccuracy include, but are not limited to: incorrect data input, OCR misinterpretation, software bugs, algorithmic limitations, or flaws in the interpretation logic.</p>
    <p>It is *your responsibility to review and verify all input data* and to *consult with qualified healthcare professionals* before relying on any interpretation. Labxio assumes no liability for outcomes arising from errors or limitations in the App's functionality or analysis.</p>

    <h2>9. Limitation of Liability</h2>
    <p>TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, LABXIO AND ITS DEVELOPERS WILL NOT BE LIABLE FOR ANY DIRECT, INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, OR PUNITIVE DAMAGES, INCLUDING DAMAGES FOR LOST PROFITS, DATA LOSS, OR MEDICAL COSTS, ARISING FROM YOUR USE OF THE APP. YOUR SOLE REMEDY FOR ANY DISSATISFACTION WITH THE APP IS TO STOP USING IT.</p>

    <h2>10. Intellectual Property</h2>
    <p>All intellectual property rights in the App, including copyrights, trademarks, and all content and algorithms, are owned by Labxio. You are granted a limited, non-exclusive, non-transferable license to use the App for your personal, educational use only.</p>

      <li>*By Us:* We reserve the right to suspend or terminate your access to the App at any time and without notice if you violate these Terms or use the App in an inappropriate or unlawful manner.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>12. Governing Law</h2>
    <p>These Terms are governed by the laws of the State of Indiana, USA, without regard to conflict of law principles. We aim to resolve any concerns or misunderstandings respectfully and informally whenever possible.</p>
