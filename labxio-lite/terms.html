    <h2>Terms & Conditions</h2>
    <div class="effective-date">Effective Date: July 31, 2025</div>
  </div>

  <div class="content-container">
    <p>Welcome to Labxio Free! These Terms & Conditions (*"Terms"*) govern your access to and use of the Labxio Free mobile application (the *"App"*). By downloading, installing, or using the App, you agree to be bound by these Terms. If you do not agree to these Terms, please do not use the App.</p>

    <div class="medical-disclaimer">
      <h3>Important Medical Disclaimer</h3>
      <p>Labxio Free is designed strictly for *informational purposes* and is not a medical device. The app provides analysis of lab results and general health insights based on structured interpretation logic derived from standard clinical guidelines.</p>
      <p>Labxio Free *does not offer medical advice, diagnosis, or treatment*. It should never be used as a substitute for professional medical consultation, diagnosis, or decision-making. *Always seek the advice of a qualified healthcare provider* with any questions you may have regarding a medical condition or treatment plan.</p>
      <p>Never delay, ignore, or disregard professional medical advice based on any information provided by this app. *Your well-being is paramount, and Labxio Free is not a tool for self-diagnosis or self-treatment.*</p>
    </div>

    <h2>1. Acceptance of Terms</h2>
    <p>By using the App, you acknowledge that you have read, understood, and agree to these Terms and our <a href="[Link to Privacy Policy]" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Privacy Policy</a>. These Terms constitute a binding legal agreement between you and Labxio Free.</p>

    <h2>2. Description of Service</h2>
    <p>Labxio Free is a mobile application that allows you to input lab results for educational interpretation. Key features include:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>*Educational Analysis:* The App provides interpretations of laboratory values based on standard reference ranges and general medical logic.</li>
      <li>*Internet Access:* Most features in Labxio Free work offline. However, photo and PDF scanning require an internet connection to load recognition libraries (e.g., PDF and OCR processing tools) from secure servers. But if you have no internet, you can still type your lab results manually for interpretation.</li>
      <li>*Privacy-First Design:* No personal health data is ever collected, stored, or transmitted by us.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>3. Ad-Supported Model</h2>
    <p>Labxio Free is **free to use** and supported by in-app advertisements.</p>
    <ul>
      <li>*Ads are provided by third-party networks* (e.g., Google AdMob).</li>
      <li>Ads may appear during your use of the App, including before or after lab result interpretations.</li>
      <li>By using the App, you consent to the display of such ads.</li>
      <li>We are not responsible for the content of third-party advertisements. If you interact with an ad, you do so at your own risk.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>4. User Responsibilities and Acceptable Use</h2>
    
    <p>By using the App, you agree to the following:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>*Personal Use Only:* The App is licensed for your personal, non-commercial, and educational use only. You may not use it for professional medical practice.</li>
      <li>*Age Requirement:* You must be at least 18 years old to use the App. Labxio Free is intended for adult users only.</li>
      <li>*Prohibited Conduct:* You will not attempt to reverse engineer, decompile, modify, or create derivative works of the App. You will also not use the App for any illegal or unauthorized purpose.</li>
      <li>*Review of Input Data:* When you use the "Upload/Scan Lab" button to scan lab reports, you understand and agree that it is your responsibility to review and confirm the accuracy of all extracted lab values, reference ranges, and units. Optical character recognition (OCR) is not always 100% accurate, and incorrect inputs may result in misleading or incorrect interpretations. You must carefully review and correct any errors before relying on the results.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>5. Data, Privacy, and Security</h2>
    <p>Your privacy is our top priority. As detailed in our <a href="[Link to Privacy Policy]" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Privacy Policy</a>, Labxio Free does not collect any personal health data. All information you enter is stored *locally on your device only*.</p>
    
    <div class="highlight-box">
      <h3>Important: Data Loss Responsibility</h3>
      <p>Because your data is stored locally, Labxio Free cannot recover it. You are solely responsible for protecting your device and data. We are not liable for any data loss resulting from device damage, loss, theft, app uninstallation, or a device factory reset.</p>
    </div>

    <h2>6. Disclaimer of Warranties</h2>
    <p>THE APP IS PROVIDED ON AN "AS IS" AND "AS AVAILABLE" BASIS. LABXIO FREE AND ITS DEVELOPERS DISCLAIM ALL WARRANTIES, WHETHER EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, AND NON-INFRINGEMENT. WE DO NOT WARRANT THAT THE APP WILL BE UNINTERRUPTED, ERROR-FREE, SECURE, OR ACCURATE IN ITS INTERPRETATIONS.</p>

    <h3>Limitations of Accuracy</h3>
    <p>While Labxio Free strives to provide accurate and educational interpretations of lab results based on established medical guidelines, we cannot guarantee the accuracy, completeness, or reliability of any analysis. The App relies on text recognition (OCR), user-entered data, and automated interpretation algorithms — all of which may contain errors. Potential sources of inaccuracy include, but are not limited to: incorrect data input, OCR misinterpretation, software bugs, algorithmic limitations, or flaws in the interpretation logic.</p>
    <p>It is *your responsibility to review and verify all input data* and to *consult with qualified healthcare professionals* before relying on any interpretation. Labxio Free assumes no liability for outcomes arising from errors or limitations in the App's functionality or analysis.</p>

    <h2>7. Limitation of Liability</h2>
    <p>TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, LABXIO FREE AND ITS DEVELOPERS WILL NOT BE LIABLE FOR ANY DIRECT, INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, OR PUNITIVE DAMAGES, INCLUDING DAMAGES FOR LOST PROFITS, DATA LOSS, OR MEDICAL COSTS, ARISING FROM YOUR USE OF THE APP. YOUR SOLE REMEDY FOR ANY DISSATISFACTION WITH THE APP IS TO STOP USING IT.</p>

    <h2>8. Intellectual Property</h2>
    <p>All intellectual property rights in the App, including copyrights, trademarks, and all content and algorithms, are owned by Labxio Free. You are granted a limited, non-exclusive, non-transferable license to use the App for your personal, educational use only.</p>

    <h2>9. Termination</h2>

      <li>*By You:* You may terminate your use of the App at any time by uninstalling it from your device.</li>
      <li>*By Us:* We reserve the right to suspend or terminate your access to the App at any time and without notice if you violate these Terms or use the App in an inappropriate or unlawful manner.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>10. Governing Law</h2>
    <p>These Terms are governed by the laws of the State of Indiana, USA, without regard to conflict of law principles. We aim to resolve any concerns or misunderstandings respectfully and informally whenever possible.</p>

    <h2>11. Terms Updates</h2>
    <p>We may update these Terms from time to time to reflect changes in our services or legal requirements. Any updated Terms will be posted on our website. We encourage you to review the Terms periodically. Your continued use of the App after updates constitutes acceptance of the new Terms.</p>
