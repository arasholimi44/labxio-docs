    <h1>LABXIO</h1>
    <h2>Privacy Policy</h2>
    <div class="effective-date">Effective Date: July 31, 2025</div>
  </div>

  <div class="content-container">
    <p>Welcome to *Labxio*! We are deeply committed to safeguarding your privacy. This Privacy Policy is designed to clearly explain what information our app collects (spoiler: very little!), how we handle it, and the important rights you have as a user. We believe in transparency and want you to feel completely secure using Labxio.</p>

    <div class="medical-disclaimer">
      <h3>Important Medical Disclaimer</h3>
      <p>Labxio is designed strictly for *informational purposes* and is not a medical device. The app provides analysis of lab results and general health insights based on structured interpretation logic derived from standard clinical guidelines.</p>
      <p>Labxio *does not offer medical advice, diagnosis, or treatment*. It should never be used as a substitute for professional medical consultation, diagnosis, or decision-making. *Always seek the advice of a qualified healthcare provider* with any questions you may have regarding a medical condition or treatment plan.</p>
      <p>Never delay, ignore, or disregard professional medical advice based on any information provided by this app. *Your well-being is paramount, and Labxio is not a tool for self-diagnosis or self-treatment.*</p>
    </div>

    <h2>1. What We Don't Collect</h2>
    <p>Labxio is built with a fundamental principle: *your privacy comes first*. This means we are designed to operate without needing to collect your personal data. We want to be unequivocally clear:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>We *do not* collect, store, or transmit any *personal information* such as your name, email address, phone number, contacts, or any other identifying details.</li>
      <li>We *do not* collect or store any of your sensitive *lab results or health data*. This information remains solely on your device.</li>
      <li>We *do not* track or collect any *device identifiers* that could be linked back to you.</li>
      <li>We *do not* collect any *location data*.</li>
      <li>We *do not* use analytics tools that track your individual usage patterns within the app.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>2. Local Data Processing</h2>
    <p>One of the core features that ensures your privacy is our *local processing model*. When you use Labxio to analyze lab results, all computational analysis is performed *entirely on your device*. This means:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>*No data is ever sent to any of our servers or external services* for processing.</li>
      <li>This design ensures *complete data confidentiality*. Your health information never leaves your device.</li>
      <li>It also allows Labxio to function *fully offline*, providing you with seamless access even without an internet connection.</li>
      <li>*Photo/Image Processing:* When you take pictures or upload photos of lab reports, these images are processed temporarily on your device for text extraction only. *Images are not stored* - neither locally nor on any servers - and are discarded immediately after processing.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>3. Subscription & Billing</h2>
    <p>Labxio uses *Google Play Billing* for all subscription management and payment processing. This means we never handle your sensitive financial information:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Your subscriptions are entirely managed through your personal *Google Play account*.</li>
      <li>We *do not* process, store, or have access to any of your billing details, payment methods, or transaction history.</li>
      <li>No other data is retrieved from Google or shared externally by Labxio regarding your billing.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Subscriptions are *billed monthly* and *automatically renew* unless canceled through your Google Play account at least 24 hours before the end of the current billing period.</p>

    <h2>4. Free Trial</h2>
    <p>Labxio offers a convenient one-time free trial without requiring any registration or account creation. Your trial usage is tracked *locally on your device* and is not linked to any personal account or identifier.</p>

    <h2>5. Data Storage & Deletion</h2>
    <p>Because your privacy is paramount, we ensure you have full control over your data within Labxio:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>*All data generated or entered within the app is stored locally and securely on your device.* This includes any personalized settings or local analysis history.</li>
      <li>If you *delete the Labxio app* from your device, or if you manually *clear the app's data* through your device settings, *all stored results and associated data will be permanently lost*.</li>
      <li>*We do not store backups* of your local data on our servers. Consequently, deleted data *cannot be recovered* by us. Please manage your device data responsibly.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>6. Third-Party Services</h2>
    <p>We believe in keeping our integrations minimal. Labxio only utilizes essential third-party services that are critical for core functionality, particularly for managing app access and subscriptions:</p>
   <ul>
  <li>
    <strong>Google Play Services:</strong> Used exclusively for handling billing and verifying your subscription status.
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Data shared:</strong> The only data shared with Labxio from Google Play Services is whether your subscription is active or inactive. No other personal data is exchanged.</li>
      <li>For more details, please review Google's own privacy policy here: <a href="https://policies.google.com/privacy" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Google Privacy Policy</a>.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Content Delivery Networks (CDNs):</strong> Used to load open-source client-side libraries for PDF rendering and optical character recognition (OCR). No personal data is transmitted during this process.
  </li>
</ul>

    <h2>7. Children's Privacy</h2>
    <p>Labxio is designed and intended for use by individuals who are *18 years of age and older*. We do not knowingly collect any personal information from children under the age of 13. If you are a parent or guardian and believe that your child under 13 has provided us with personal information, please contact us immediately so we can address the situation. Parents or guardians are solely responsible for monitoring the use of Labxio by minors in their care.</p>

    <h2>8. International Privacy</h2>
    <p>Given Labxio's fundamental design where *no personal data is collected or stored on our servers*, and all processing occurs locally on your device, our privacy practices naturally align with and support major international privacy regulations, including but not limited to the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR). There are *no cross-border data transfers* of any personal user data because we simply don't collect it.</p>

    <h2>9. Policy Updates</h2>
    <p>This Privacy Policy may be updated from time to time to reflect changes in our practices or legal requirements. When we make material updates, we will post the revised policy on our website. We encourage you to review the Privacy Policy periodically. Continued use of Labxio after any changes means you accept the updated policy.</p>

    <h2>10. Contact Us</h2>
    <p>Your privacy is important to us, and we are here to answer any questions you may have. If you have any inquiries, concerns, or feedback regarding this Privacy Policy or our data practices, please do not hesitate to reach out to us:</p>
